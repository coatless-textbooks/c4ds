# Instructor Guide

Within this chapter, we will focus on the underlying techniques and technology
required to foster a programming method course. 

## RStudio Toolchain

[RStudio Inc.](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a popular company within the _R_
community. They are primary responsible for the _RStudio IDE_ and popular _R_
packages like `rmarkdown`, `shiny`, and the `tidyverse` ecosystem. As _RStudio Inc._
is a company, their products do cost money; however, each product has an
[academic pricing](https://www.rstudio.com/pricing/academic-pricing/) scheme
that -- for accredited public or private schools -- effectively make a majority
of their Pro products free for teaching purposes. Any use of their products for academic research will void this type of license. 

RStudio makes available special research licenses for their products as well.
These licenses make their Pro line-up available for `50%` less than the overall
fee. Though, many of their open source solutions should suffix if set to run on
an intranet deployment.

### RStudio's Academic Pricing {#academic-pricing}

To receive any of RStudio's Pro products for free, you _must_:

1. provide a syllabus for the course using the technology;
    - the products being used do _not_ have to be specified, but it is preferred. 
2. email from a qualified academic institution email address;
    - e.g. use `@myuniversity.edu`
3. request an educational discount by e-mailing <info@rstudio.com>

My e-mail template for the requesting academic licensing is:

> Greetings and Salutations,
>
> Would it be possible to obtain an academic license to operate 
**RSTUDIO_PRODUCTS_HERE***? I am **YOUR_NAME** within the Department of 
**DEPT_NAME** at the University of **YOUR_STATE**.
>  
> These services are currently being used during **SEMESTER** in **COURSE NAME**.
> The syllabus is available for public viewing here:
>  
> <link-to-the-syllabus>
> 

At the end of the syllabus, I provide a description of the course software:

> **Software**
> 
> The course will use the
> [**R** statistical computing language](https://cloud.r-project.org/). 
> The integrated developer environment that we will use to explore *R* is
> [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) made by
> [RStudio Inc](https://www.rstudio.com). As a result, you _must_ use _R_ since
> the course staff will only be able to provide support for **R**. 


### RStudio IDE


#### RStudio Cloud (New!)

RStudio Cloud provides the means to run a course online within a controlled 
environment. Using RStudio Cloud leads to minimal upstart as the R and RStudio
environments are pre-configured. Furthermore, this allows for students to 
use university resources -- e.g. a computer in a computer lab -- and be able
to immediately pick up at home or another location. This also decreases the
financial burden on students as they are no longer required to explicitly
have a computer that is capable of performing computations.

#### RStudio Server (Pro)

#### RStudio in a Container

### Shiny

### RStudio Connect

New entrant.

Benefits:

- Publish lecture slides with embedded code editor areas to encourage students
  to interact with lecture and provide a metric for engagement during lecture.
- Improved homework turn-in as Rmd's are built on the server. 
- Local publishing platform for student work that exposes students to 
  industry related technologies and needs.
- [Sandboxed environments](http://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/process-management.html#process-management-sandboxing) for process security.


### Alternatives

Locally installed IDE's

OS-independent:

- OpenAnalytics' [Architect](https://www.getarchitect.io/)
- GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io) Editor with the [Rbox](https://atom.io/packages/rbox)
- [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org/)
- [RAnalyticFlow](http://r.analyticflow.com/en/)
- [StatET](http://www.walware.de/goto/statet) is an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/) based IDE

OS-specific:

- Windows
    - Microsoft's [_R_ Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/features/rtvs/)
- macOS
    - [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)

Web-based IDE's that compete with RStudio Cloud and RStudio Server:

- [R-Brain](https://r-brain.io/en/)
- [DisplayR](https://www.displayr.com/)
- [Exploratory](https://exploratory.io/)

## Using GitHub

### Persistent Student Repositories

### Single-use student repositories

### Team workflows

### Securing Turn-in Times


## Discussion Forums

### Discourse

### GitHub Issue Tracker

### Piazza

We've found that [Piazza](https://piazza.com/),
[Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/index.html), and
[Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/) are relatively _poor_ solutions to
fostering high-caliber discussions.
The design of the software is inherently flawed for a programming class as it
focuses on quick convergent thinking instead of a divergent thought process
often found with programming techniques. Furthermore, the applicability of 
these platforms is largely restricted to the realm of academia. Students
deserve exposure to technology that they might find in industry whenever 
possible.
